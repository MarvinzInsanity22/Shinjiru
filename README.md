# Dependencies

These are the packages required on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) to build:

- qt5-base 
- qt5-declarative 
- qt5-networkauth 
- qt5-tools 
- qt5-quickcontrols 
- qt5-quickcontrols2 
- git 
- libx11 
- libxtst 
- libxinerama

Qt can be installed using their [Online Installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) instead for an overall easier experience, especially on distros without qt5-networkauth.
Typically everything else should already be available.

Running `INSTALL.linux` should typically be enough üëç
